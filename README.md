# Tailwind CSS Gradient Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS gradients. The gradient in the example is distorted or fails to apply correctly.

## Bug Description
The `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500` utility class is used to create a linear gradient from blue to purple. However, the gradient appears distorted or does not render properly. This can happen due to incorrect configuration, conflicting styles, or other factors.
